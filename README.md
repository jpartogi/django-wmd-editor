Django WMD Editor
=================


A [WMD-Editor][1] wrapper for Django applications.


Installation
------------

Installing django-wmd-editor should be really as easy as possible. To install
django-wmd-editor all you need to do is just follow these steps:

1. Download and install django-wmd-editor.
    
    You can use `PIP` to install the latest version of django-wmd-editor from github like so:
    
        $ pip install -e git://github.com/marcuswhybrow/django-wmd-editor.git#egg=django_wmd_editor
    
    or you can run `python setup.py install`.

3. Install django-wmd-editor in your django application

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          'wmd',
          ...
        )

4. In the `wmd.js` file on line 49, it explicitly states where images are located in your project. By default this is set to `"/static/wmd/images"`, you must change this if your static files are located elsewhere.

    Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect the static files in all of your apps (including this one).


Usage
-----

1. In your models:

	    from wmd import models as wmd_models
	    description = wmd_models.MarkDownField()

2. In your forms:

	    from wmd.widgets import MarkDownInput
	    description = forms.CharField(widget=MarkDownInput())
	__Note:__ Use `forms.CharField(widget=AdminMarkDownInput())` if you want the "preview" functionality to work in the admin.

3. You also need to add these lines on your template to load the wmd static files:

	    <head>
	    	{{ form.media }}
	    </head>
	__Note:__ In the admin, these static files are loaded automatically.

Configuration
-------------

In your django settings file, use this configuration for setting up your django wmd editor

- `WMD_SHOW_PREVIEW`: Whether to show the preview or not. This is the setting if you use the wmd editor outside the admin.
   Values: True, False
   Default: False
- `WMD_ADMIN_SHOW_PREVIEW`: Whether to show the preview in the admin or not.
   Values: True, False
   Default: True
